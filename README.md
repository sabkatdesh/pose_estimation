# 💪 AI-Powered Bicep Curl Counter (Real-Time)

This is a real-time AI project that can **detect and count bicep curls** from a **live video feed** using computer vision. No need for wearables or fitness devices — just your camera and the power of AI.

Currently, the system supports **bicep curls only**, but is designed to be easily extended to support other exercises in future updates.

## 📸 How It Works

- Uses your **webcam or any connected camera** to detect your body movements.
- Tracks the **angle of your arm** to determine when a full curl is completed.
- Counts reps live on-screen and can be adjusted for different difficulty levels.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Python** – Base programming language  
- **OpenCV** – Video capture and real-time processing  
- **MediaPipe** – Pose detection and landmark tracking  
- **CVZone** – Simplified overlays and UI  
- **TensorFlow** – Trained custom model (future use for multi-exercise support)
